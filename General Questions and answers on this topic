ðŸ‘‰ Tests: Systematic debugging.
ðŸ§  Step-by-step: Metrics â†’ Network latency â†’ App logs â†’ DB performance â†’ Scaling â†’ Caching (CloudFront, Redis).

---

### **13. How do you implement blue-green or canary deployments?**

ðŸ‘‰ Tests: Deployment strategy knowledge.
ðŸ§  Two identical environments â†’ route traffic gradually â†’ rollback easily â†’ use Route 53 / Load Balancer weighting.

---

### **14. Explain IAM best practices.**

ðŸ‘‰ Tests: Security knowledge.
ðŸ§  Principle of least privilege, role-based access, MFA, no root access, password policies, audit via CloudTrail.

---

### **15. How do you use CloudWatch or similar tools to prevent outages?**

ðŸ‘‰ Tests: Proactive monitoring.
ðŸ§  Use metrics + alarms + automation (Lambda remediation), dashboards, anomaly detection.

---

### **16. Describe your process when handling customer-reported issues in production.**

ðŸ‘‰ Tests: Support mindset, calmness under pressure.
ðŸ§  Gather logs, reproduce, mitigate quickly, communicate, RCA, automate detection/prevention.

---

### **17. How do you maintain configuration consistency across multiple environments?**

ðŸ‘‰ Tests: Configuration management.
ðŸ§  Ansible/Chef, environment variables, templates, GitOps model, tagging and versioning.

---

### **18. Explain how you would secure S3 buckets and EC2 instances.**

ðŸ‘‰ Tests: Security & AWS fundamentals.
ðŸ§  Use private ACLs, IAM policies, encryption (KMS), logging, VPC endpoints, patch EC2s.

---

### **19. Whatâ€™s your experience with version control (Git)?**

ðŸ‘‰ Tests: Collaboration & coding basics.
ðŸ§  Branching, PRs, merge conflicts, hooks in pipelines, tagging releases.

---

### **20. How do you handle on-call incidents and prevent recurrence?**

ðŸ§  Incident management, postmortems, automation, alert thresholds, documentation.

---

## ðŸ’¬ **B. Behavioral Section (10 Key Leadership Principle Questions)**

These are **guaranteed** in Amazon interviews â€” use the **STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)**.

---

### **1. Tell me about a time you took ownership of a production issue.**
